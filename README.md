# Welcome, I’m Salman  
**“Obfuscation is an art. Elegance is a trap. Hack the idea, not the tool.”**  
— me, probably.

I’m a second-year Computer Engineering student at King Saud University, deep in the trenches of shell prompts, cloud consoles, and the occasional existential monologue.

## 💻 What I’m Into  
- 🛡️ Cloud Security, Linux, Reverse Engineering  
- 🧠 I don’t follow the meta — I *am* the weird pick that works (think Gunlance in Monster Hunter)  
- ⛓️ Obsessed with systems people don’t want to touch  

## 🧰 Tools of Choice  
`Linux` • `Bash` • `Python` • `Rust` • `AWS` • `GCP` • `eBPF` • `Reverse Engineering`

## 🎯 Active Quests  
- ☁️ Building out multi-cloud setups with focus on AWS  
- 🔍 Digging into reverse engineering and low-level internals  
- 🧩 Sharpening niche skills for cyber warfare — odd but effective  

## 📜 Philosophy  
- Specialize in what everyone avoids  
- Write dense, beautiful, slightly cursed code  
- Be unpredictable enough to never be typecast  

## 🗃️ Fun Bits  
- 🥋 I train in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu — I like mounting people like partitions  
- 🎮 Yes, my naming convention for projects is just Touhou/Vocaloid puns
