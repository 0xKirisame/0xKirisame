I'm a second-year Computer Engineering student with a keyboard in one hand and a terminal in the other. Currently walking the fine line between deep-tech obsession and cloud security dreams ☁️🔐

- 🛡️ Focused on **Cloud Security**, **Linux**, and **Reverse Engineering**
- 🎓 Studying at **King Saud University** — surviving exams, thriving in shell prompts
- 🧠 I don't chase the meta — I *am* the weird pick that works (think Gunlance in Monster Hunter)

I believe in:

- Writing code like it’s poetry — dense, beautiful, and slightly cursed
- Staying just unpredictable enough that people never assume correctly
